### Christmas Puzzle
Christmas puzzle is a modular Christmas decorations to enhance your tree's appearence and make it perfect.

It's a christmas decoration, designed as a modular decoration equipped with: reindeer, sleigh and gift packages. This type of decoration encourages the development of creativity and ensures that the decorations are unique and all different from each other.

### MinioBot
Miniobot is a tiny robot built for educational purposes with the intent of bringing people closer to the fascinating and complex world of robotics. This bot can combine the art of 3D printing with the charm of embedded systems.

It is composed by a structure in PLA, a 98.5% recyclable bio-based material ideal for lightness. It mounts an Arduino Nano microcontroller on an expansion shield which allows it to use additional servo motors and sensors.

Miniobot can move, raise its arms, reproduce sounds and songs, avoid obstacles and much more!

It represents the perfect harmony between education and robotics, programmed in C-like language with the Otto DIY project library. The body was designed to perfectly contain the sensors and avoid small design errors previously encountered in the original model. All of this gives it a very nice and captivating look, similar to the minions from the “Despicable me” movie.
